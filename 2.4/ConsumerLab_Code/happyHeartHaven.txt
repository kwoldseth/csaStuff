The Happy Heart Haven is definitely the happiest place in North County! My Husband and little one went to the sanctuary for their Friday Kids Club and couldn't stop raving about it. My Husband loved everything about it from family owned, Owner, Cristi's background and her helpful husband, Michael, *sweet animals, craft time, snack time and most importantly following social distancing guidelines/ safety protocols are practiced during this pandemic. Everything is outside, organized, plenty of parking, *clean and everyone felt safe the whole time. This is the *BEST *fun and *memorable outing for your children especially during COVID-19. I seriously wish we could buy a membership and go there all the time!
